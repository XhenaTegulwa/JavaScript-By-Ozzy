// Snytax of Variables
// Key words for declaring variables (let , var, const)
// Always use small letters when Declaring variables
// Never declare a variable twice
// a variable declared with a const should always have a value
// Const declares constant variables (I cant be changed after being declared)
// Variable names should not start with a numbr and should not have space in between
let firstname = "Xhena";
const num1 = 10;
var lastname = "Tegulwa"
console .log (firstname);
console .log (num1);
console .log (lastname);
